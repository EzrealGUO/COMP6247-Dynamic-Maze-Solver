This is a new Dynamic Maze Solver based on Deep Q-learning Network Algorithm.
The COMP6247Maze20212022.npy gives the maze environment.
To load the maze, you need to import the python file rea_maze.py and apply related funtion.
To explore this work, you are encouraged to run the Maze_Solver on Jupyter Notebook.
The txt files Solution.txt, Solution2.txt and action.txt provide possible solution for the question.
